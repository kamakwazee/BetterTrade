BetterTrade 1.1.2 for Minecraft 1.5.2
===========

Minecraft mod for the villagers to give better trade. It is now available for Singleplayer and Multiplayer, and it is compatible with minecraft forge.


My Build Process
===========

* I first run recompile.bat. 
* Then I run reobfuscate.bat. 
* I then copy all of those files over to a build directory I have set up which contains the META-INF.
* I then package all of that into a zip file using 7-zip. 
* Finally, I rename it to be a jar file, and I test it in minecraft.
